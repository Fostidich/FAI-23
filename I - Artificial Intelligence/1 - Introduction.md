The field of artificial intelligence is concerned with intelligent entities that can compute how to act effectively in a wide variety of situations.
# What is AI?
AI can act on two different dimensions: human vs. rational and thought vs. behavioral; as a consequence, four combinations arise.
Acting rationally is our branch of choice.
## The rational agent approach
An agent is something that acts so as to achieve the best outcome, or the best expected one. In a nutshell, AI has focused on the study and construction of agents that "do the right thing", in the sense of pursuing our objectives.
## The foundation of artificial intelligence
To power AI systems is decision theory, often combined with probability and utility theories.
Furthermore, representation paradigms come into play, especially in knowledge-based agents where external stimulus must be translated into internal data, which will be manipulated by many processes to derive new internal representations to be translated back into actions.
Another field of AI focuses on intelligence augmentation (IA), which can also be useful for the human-computer interaction.
In case of stochastic optimal control problems, the goal of AI is to maximize a cost function over time. This is roughly the standard model of AI: designing system that behaves optimally.
## The history of artificial intelligence
One of the first model proposed for AI is the model of artificial neurons in which each neuron is characterized as being on or off, with the switch that turns on in response to stimulation of a sufficient number of neighboring neurons.
In recent years, deep learning is one of the biggest field of AI that has come into play. The term refers to machines working with multiple layers of simple adjustable computing elements, in the form of convolutional neural networks often used in speech and images recognition.
