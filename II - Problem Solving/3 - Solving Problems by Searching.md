A problem solving agent searches for a correct sequence of action that reaches the goal state. This can be not immediately obvious so it is to be planned ahead. Representation used in this case are atomic, and for the environment it's easier to consider it episodic, single agent, fully observable, deterministic, static, discrete and known.
Furthermore, two types of algorithms can be distinguished:
- in the **informed algorithms** the agents is able to estimate how far the goal is;
- in the **uninformed algorithms** the agent has no such estimation.
